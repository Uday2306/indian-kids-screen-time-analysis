# ðŸ“± Screen Time Analysis of Indian Children

A Power BI dashboard project that analyzes **digital habits, device preferences, and health impacts** among children in India.  
This visualization highlights the growing concern of excessive screen usage and its implications.


ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project uses survey data from **9,700+ children** across India to understand:
- Daily average screen time
- Device preferences
- Regional differences (Urban vs Rural)
- Educational vs recreational usage ratio
- Associated health issues

The insights are visualized using **Power BI** to create an interactive and easy-to-understand dashboard.

ðŸ“Š Key Insights
- Average Daily Screen Time: 4.35 hours
- 85% of kids exceed the recommended daily limit
- Smartphones are the most used device, followed by TVs and tablets
- Urban children spend significantly more time on screens than rural children
- Common health issues reported:  
  - Poor sleep quality  
  - Eye strain  
  - Headaches and anxiety
